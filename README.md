#Molecular Property Prediction using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) on QM9 Dataset
This repository presents the outcome of a 5-week structured research project, where I mentored a team of 15 students to build an end-to-end molecular property prediction system using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the QM9 dataset, implemented with PyTorch Geometric.

The journey started with teaching the fundamentals of Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning, gradually advancing toward Graph Neural Networks, culminating in a complete pipeline for molecular graph learning and property prediction.
Mentorship Roadmap
Over 5 weeks, I guided the team through the following structured learning and implementation path:

1. Python & Data Science Fundamentals
2. aught NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation

Introduced data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

2. Core Machine Learning Concepts
Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Regression & Classification algorithms

Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, MAE, RMSE, RÂ²)

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Guided the team through analyzing and visualizing the QM9 molecular dataset

Helped uncover relationships between molecular properties

4. Graph Neural Network Foundations
Explained graph theory essentials and why molecules are naturally represented as graphs

Introduced PyTorch Geometric and its GNN layers (GCN, GAT, etc.)

5. End-to-End GNN Pipeline Development
Graph Construction: Atoms as nodes, bonds as edges

Feature Engineering: Extracting node and edge features

Model Implementation: Building and training GNN models

Training & Evaluation: Predicting molecular properties and evaluating results

Visualization: Displaying molecular structures and comparing actual vs predicted properties
